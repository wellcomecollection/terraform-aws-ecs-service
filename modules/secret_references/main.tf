  # If a secret name has a colon in it, then it is a reference to
  # a specific key within a JSON object secret.
  #
  # e.g. if you have the secret
  #
  #     SecretId = credentials
  #     SecretValue = {"username": "wellcome", "password": "s3kr1t!"}
  #
  # then the secret "credentials:username" would refer to "wellcome"
  # and "credentials:password" would refer to "s3kr1t!".
  #
  # This module provides a way to construct the correct ARNs for secrets
  # both with and without references.
  #
  # Note: we construct the ARNs by hand rather than using a "data" block
  # so the secrets don't need to exist when we're planning, e.g. if we're
  # creating secrets alongside the ECS service.
  #
  # See "Example referencing a specific key within a secret" here:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/specifying-sensitive-data-secrets.html
